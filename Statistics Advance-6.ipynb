    "Q1. Assumptions Required for ANOVA and Examples of Violations\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "1.\tIndependence: Observations must be independent of each other.\n",
    "2.\tNormality: The residuals (errors) of the model should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "3.\tHomogeneity of Variances: The variances among the groups should be approximately equal.\n",
    "Examples of Violations:\n",
    "•\tIndependence: If data points are collected from related subjects (e.g., repeated measurements on the same subjects), the independence assumption is violated.\n",
    "•\tNormality: If residuals are heavily skewed or have outliers, the normality assumption is violated.\n",
    "•\tHomogeneity of Variances: If one group has much larger variance compared to others, the assumption is violated. This can be tested using Levene's test.\n",
    "Q2. Types of ANOVA\n",
    "1.\tOne-Way ANOVA: Used when comparing means across one factor with multiple levels. Example: Comparing average test scores among different teaching methods.\n",
    "2.\tTwo-Way ANOVA: Used when comparing means across two factors simultaneously. Example: Comparing the effects of different diets and exercise levels on weight loss.\n",
    "3.\tRepeated Measures ANOVA: Used when the same subjects are measured multiple times under different conditions. Example: Measuring students' performance before and after an intervention.\n",
    "Q3. Partitioning of Variance in ANOVA\n",
    "Partitioning of Variance:\n",
    "•\tTotal Sum of Squares (SST): Measures the total variation in the data.\n",
    "•\tExplained Sum of Squares (SSE): Measures the variation explained by the model (between groups).\n",
    "•\tResidual Sum of Squares (SSR): Measures the variation not explained by the model (within groups).\n",
    "Importance: Understanding partitioning of variance helps in determining how much of the total variability in the data is explained by the differences between groups versus the variability within groups.\n",

    "Q6. Interpretation of ANOVA Results\n",
    "With an F-statistic of 5.23 and a p-value of 0.02:\n",
    "•\tConclusion: There is a statistically significant difference between at least two groups, as the p-value is less than the typical alpha level of 0.05.\n",
    "•\tInterpretation: You would need to perform a post-hoc test to determine which specific groups differ significantly from each other.\n",
    "Q7. Handling Missing Data in Repeated Measures ANOVA\n",
    "Handling Methods:\n",
    "1.\tListwise Deletion: Exclude all cases with missing data. Can reduce sample size and power.\n",
    "2.\tImputation: Replace missing values with estimated values. Can introduce bias if the imputation method is not suitable.\n",
    "3.\tMixed-Effects Models: Account for missing data within the model. Suitable for complex cases but requires careful implementation.\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "•\tListwise Deletion: May lead to loss of data and power.\n",
    "•\tImputation: Risk of introducing bias.\n",
    "•\tMixed-Effects Models: Complex but often most robust approach.\n",
    "Q8. Common Post-Hoc Tests\n",
    "1.\tTukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD): Compares all pairs of groups while controlling the family-wise error rate.\n",
    "2.\tBonferroni Correction: Adjusts p-values to account for multiple comparisons.\n",
    "3.\tScheffé's Test: Useful for testing all possible contrasts, not just pairwise comparisons.\n",
    "Example: After finding a significant difference in a one-way ANOVA comparing the effects of different treatments, Tukey's HSD can identify which specific treatments differ from each other.\n",
